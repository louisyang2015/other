# FPGA

FPGAs are not that practical in real life - because they are more expensive than processors. Usually programming a processor is the cheaper way to solve a problem.

Still, they let engineers design circuits to solve specialized problems. The ability to accelerate C++ by building a circuit using HDL makes me feel like a CPU designer. It's the ultimate freedom.

## algorithm_acceleration
This is an algorithm acceleration project from 2011.
* fpga - notes and documentation, both about the project, and about FPGA design in general
* reports - project slides and reports
