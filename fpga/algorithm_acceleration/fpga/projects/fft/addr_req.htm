<h1>FFT Addressing Requirements</h1>
<h2>The Radix-2 FFT</h2>
<p>The radix-2 FFT uses a butterfly structure that takes two input and creates 
two output. The data needs to be positioned such that the butterfly takes inputs 
from two memory elements, and sends outputs to two memory elements. There must 
not be a situation where the butterfly wants two inputs from the same memory, or 
has to write two outputs to the same memory.</p>

<h2>Eight Point FFT</h2>
<p>Figuring out a way to line data up for the 8-point FFT is sufficient to 
illustrate a general addressing algorithm.</p>

<p>Note that with this algorithm, the data processing is not done in place. So 
there will be one set of memory holding the data being read, and a separate set 
of memory holding the data being written.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>FFT Addressing when Reading</h2>
<p>The address value when reading from the memory is sequential counting, from 0 
to 7 in this case. The butterfly will alternate where it get its input. This 
alternating depends on the FFT stage. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>FFT Addressing when Writing</h2>
<p>The Mem0 address is sequential. There is alternation of where to put the 
output. The alternating pattern is related to the FFT stage.</p>
<p>The Mem1 address inverts a bit of the sequential address. For example, in the 
second FFT stage, the Mem1 address is 2, 3, 0, 1. This is the sequential address 
0, 1, 2, 3, with the second LSB inverted.</p>
