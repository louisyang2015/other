<h2>OnChip Memory</h2>
<p>For read-only memory, an initialization file is needed. When using the &quot;hex&quot; 
format, it seems the Quartus software will warn of &quot;overflow&quot; unless the &quot;hex&quot; 
file is 1 word per line. This behavior is observed during the FFT and Array 
Processor projects, where the twiddle factor needs to be stored as read-only 
memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>FIFO</h2>
<p>In the Array Processor project, a dual clock, look ahead FIFO is used. In 
that project, after doing a read or write, it seems that you have to wait a cycle for the rdempty / wrfull flag to be 
true. In other words, it&#39;s not possible to read / write continuously, because 
the &quot;rdempty&quot; and &quot;wrfull&quot; flags are not immediately correct after each 
read/write.</p>
