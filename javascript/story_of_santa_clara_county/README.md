# Story of Santa Clara County
**To run the project, double click on 'index.html'.**

## Summary

My visualization examines the growth of Santa Clara county, which is home to several of the most successful technology companies in the world. The visualization focuses on four areas: absolute population growth, relative population growth, Asian immigration, and stock prices of a few large technology companies.

## Design

For population growth and stock prices, I used the line graph. This is what people typically encounter when they read about population growth or stock market activity.

For the relative population growth and Asian immigration, I used an area chart. It shows the change in proportions over time.

Color choices - the default color in most cases is 'steelblue'. This is a non-bright color, and it's used in the D3.js examples that I looked at. I thought those looked good so I just took that color. For highlighting I used orange. In the two area graphs I used one of the color sets from "colorbrewer2.org".
