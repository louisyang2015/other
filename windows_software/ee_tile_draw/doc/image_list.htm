<h1 align="center"><font color="#008000">ImageList</font></h1>
<p><font size="4">This class will load the various &quot;.wmf&quot; files first, and load 
it once. After start up, the image list will return a pointer to an image when 
the image is requested by ID. A separate method, &quot;get_rotate&quot;, will get the 
image for the rotation button.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The ImageList itself is quite easy to understand, no need to 
explain it much. <font color="#008000"><b>ImageList also contains GDI+ startup 
code in the constructor and the shutdown code in the destructor.</b></font> The 
reason is that the memory pointers to Image objects needs to be de-allocated 
first before the GDI+ shutdown. Once the GDI+ shutdown code has executed, I 
could not use &quot;delete image&quot; to de-allocate the memory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">While writing the ImageList class, I have decided to use 
&quot;Shell sort&quot; as my basic sorting algorithm. So this ImageList class has a well 
documented shell sort for me to save for the future.</font></p>
