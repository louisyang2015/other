## Potential Modifications

You might need to resize the forms in "EditFraction.vb" and "Form1.vb". 

This project uses WinForm, which predates Windows Vista and does not scale gracefully to different DPI settings. After Windows Vista was released, I switched to WPF due to DPI issues in WinForm.

## Usage
