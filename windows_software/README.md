# Windows

Year: 2002

Microsoft released .Net version 1.0 on Feb 13, 2002. For me that was Microsoft at its peak:

* Desktop: Windows had 90%+ market share
* Browser: Internet Explorer had a 80%+ market share
* Server: .Net 1.0 came with ASP.Net 1.0, the best server application framework at the time
* Tablets and handhelds: the market was young, but Microsoft was an early leader

So Windows was important
