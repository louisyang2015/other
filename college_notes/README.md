# College

Year: 1998 ~ 2004

I used to be young too... worry free and in good health. :smiley:

All "growing up" brought was problems, worries, and declining health. 

Too bad we all have to grow up. :cry:

It's been many years since college, but there was plenty of **timeless knowledge**:
* **circuits**
* **logic design**
* **physics**
* **semiconductor_physics**

and then there's something that's hopefully not so timeless. Hopefully people no longer had to do:
* assembly

or at least replace the 8086 class with a microcontroller class.
