<h1 align="center"><font color="#008000">Deviations from the Ideal</font></h1>
<h2><font color="#008000">Early Effect</font></h2>
<p><font size="4">The biggest deviation between theory and experiment can be 
found in the common emitter output characteristics:</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The reason for increasing I<sub>C</sub> as V<sub>EC</sub> 
increase is called <font color="#008000">base width modulation</font> or the
<font color="#008000">Early Effect</font>. As a larger and larger V<sub>EC</sub> 
reverse bias is applied, the depletion region at the BC junction grows, and the 
width (W) of the quasineutral base region decreases.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Under active mode biasing the EB junction experiences only 
small forward bias and plays a negligible role in modulating the quasineutral 
width of the base. The BC junction gets a much larger depletion region due to 
the reverse bias there.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">By giving the base a higher doping than the collector, most of 
the depletion region at the CB junction will be inside the collector and not the 
base. This reduces the effect of based width modulation.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font color="#008000">Punch-Through</font></h2>
<p><font size="4">If the reverse bias at the CB junction got sufficiently large, 
then it's possible that the entire base quasineutral region disappears due to 
the expanding CB depletion region.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0140.jpg" width="522" height="301"></p>
<p><font size="4">In this case, holes injected at the emitter will easily cross 
into the collector region. Only a slight increase in -V<sub>CB</sub> gives rise 
to a large increase in I<sub>C </sub>. This is one way for the BJT to enter a 
breakdown state.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font color="#008000">Avalanche Multiplication Breakdown</font></h2>
<p><font size="4">Just like the diode, a sufficiently large reverse bias at the 
BC junction can trigger an avalanche breakdown. </font>
<font color="#008000" size="4">For the BJT in active mode, there are two 
different scenarios for avalanche breakdown, depending on whether the BJT is in 
common base mode or in common emitter mode.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">As the reverse bias across BC junction increase, more and more 
electron-hole pairs are generated by impact ionization. The generated electrons 
are send to the base. If the BJT is in common base configuration, the electrons 
can leave the BJT through the base terminal. If the BJT is in common emitter 
configuration, the base current is fixed, and the electrons can leave only by 
going out through the emitter terminal. This can result in a feedback because 
electrons entering the emitter from the base will lead to more holes going from 
emitter to the base, which then leads to a greater I<sub>E</sub> and more impact 
ionizations in the BC junction.</font></p>
<p><i><font size="4">Book's diagram of the common emitter feedback situation:</font></i></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0141.jpg" width="1078" height="765"></p>
<p><font size="4">The presence of the feed back means that common emitter 
configurations face a breakdown earlier than common base configurations. 
Although V<sub>EC</sub> <font face="Times New Roman">&#8776; -V<sub>CB</sub> , but V<sub>CE0</sub> 
(for example 90 V) is much smaller than V<sub>CB0</sub> (for example 120 V).</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">For BJT, this early avalanche due to 
feed back is detrimental. In other devices though this effect could be positive.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman" color="#008000">Series Resistance</font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This is the resistance associated with 
the p, n, p segments. In general, one may view previously derived relationships 
as only applying to the &quot;heart&quot; or central portion of the transistor, often 
called the &quot;<font color="#008000">intrinsic transistor&quot;</font>.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0142.jpg" width="567" height="540"></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The intrinsic transistor is marked by 
the dashed lines.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman" color="#008000">Geometry Effects</font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Cross sectional pictures of the BJT 
device:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0143.jpg" width="762" height="851"></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The intrinsic transistor is again 
marked by the dashed lines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">The book went over two geometry effects 
very briefly:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Emitter Area &#8800; Collector Area</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Current Crowding</font></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#008000" size="4">
Recombination-Generation Current</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Under most active bias conditions, the 
R-G current plays a small role. The bulk of the current going through the BC 
reverse bias is due to the holes coming from the emitter portion of the BJT.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#008000" size="4">Graded Base</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Due to manufacturing methods, the 
doping within the base is not a constant as assumed in the ideal transistor 
analysis. A doping variation with position will give rise to a built-in electric 
field. If the BJT is made such that the field is assisting the transport of 
minority carriers across the quasineutral width of the base, then this deviation 
from the ideal would be beneficial.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" color="#008000" size="4">Figures of Merit</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">These are plots that can be quickly 
interpreted to determine the extent of deviation from the ideal.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0144.jpg" width="633" height="580"></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">In the above plot, ideally both I<sub>B</sub> 
and I<sub>C</sub> should be straight lines with the same q/kT slope.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">This is another figure of merit:</font></p>
