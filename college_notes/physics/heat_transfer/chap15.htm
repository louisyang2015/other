<p><font size="4" color="#008000">Introduction</font></p>
<p><font size="4">When current (I) flows through a resistance (R), the heat 
generated is I<sup>2 </sup>R.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Electronic circuits are powered by low voltages, usually under
<font face="Times New Roman">±15 V, but the currents involved may be very high, 
sometimes a few hundred amperes.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="4">Vacuum tubes had heat dissipation problems. When the 
transistor was first introduced, it was touted in the newspapers as a device 
that &quot;produces no heat&quot;. But as the year go by and people pack millions of 
transistors onto a single chip, the heat dissipation problems reappears.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The failure rate of electronic devices increases almost 
exponentially with the operating temperature.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#008000">Cooling Load of Electronic Equipment</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#008000">Duty cycle</font> --- the fraction of 
time an electronic component is on. A 5W power transistor, for example, will 
dissipate an average of 2W of power if it is active only 40 percent of the time. 
Although most electronic devices operate for long periods of time, some 
applications never run long enough to reach steady operation. For these 
transient operation scenarios, a common approach is to have a double-wall 
construction for the enclosure of the electronic equipment. The space between 
the walls is filled with a wax with a suitable melting temperature. As the 
electronic device heats, the wax melts. If the device doesn't run for an 
extended period of time, the wax will have time to solidify itself.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#008000">Dynamic temperature of air</font></p>
<p><font size="4">At first thought, the cooling of missiles can be done by using 
the air that rams the missile, creating forced convection. However, there is a 
temperature increase associated with air ramming the missile at high speed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">If we let V = 320 m/s, then T<sub>dynamic</sub> is 51 <sup>o</sup>C. 
So if air is normally 30 <sup>o</sup>C, air moving at 320 m/s is 81 <sup>o</sup>C.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Missiles are usually cooled with the liquid fuel that they 
carry, not by ramming the air.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#008000">Natural convection in space</font> --- 
There is no natural convection in space because there is no gravity, and hence 
no buoyancy, in space.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><font color="#008000">The most effective ways of cooling</font> 
include using forced convection of water, and dipping the hot object in a fluid 
and boiling the fluid.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" color="#008000">Manufacturing of electronic equipment</font></p>
<p><font size="4">In semiconductor physics, a junction is where the p material 
meets the n material. In heat transfer, a <font color="#008000">junction</font> 
is a site of heat generation. It is the circuitry where electrons flow, and 
where the temperature is the highest.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The expansion coefficient of the plastic is about 20 times 
that of silicon. Therefore, bonding the silicon chip directly to the plastic 
case would result in too much thermal stress. Instead, the chip is bounded to a 
lead frame and the lead frame is bounded to the plastic frame.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0080.jpg" width="446" height="310"></p>
<p><font size="4">The inside of the case is usually filled with a gas that is a 
poor conductor of heat. Heat going through the gas is modeled by having a
<font color="#008000">junction-to-case resistance (R<sub>junction-case</sub>)</font><sub>
</sub>.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0081.jpg" width="416" height="329"></p>
<p><font size="4">Because we don't want moisture go get to the chip, the casing 
is highly sealed.</font></p>

<h2><font color="#008000">Conduction Cooling</font></h2>
<p><font size="4">The R<sub>junction-case</sub> path is not the path of least 
resistance (I don't know why the book spends so much time on it, perhaps there 
are special cases where R<sub>junction-case</sub> is the path of least 
resistance).</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The path of least resistance is heat flowing out of the legs 
of the chip. Here's a picture of the chip again with the path ways drawn:</font></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0083.jpg" width="462" height="321"></p>

<p><font size="4">This set up is called the dual in-line package (DIP).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The area marked &quot;junction&quot; is the point farthest from the ends 
of the leads, and also the hottest place on the chip. The book makes it look as 
if &quot;junction&quot; is something mounted on top of a chip, both in the picture and in 
the various problems and examples. In reality, heat is produced throughout the 
chip. But the mathematical way to account for heat production is to cut the chip 
into a separate chip and junction object. The &quot;junction&quot; object is one producing 
heat, while the chip object is just thermal resistance to the heat produced in 
the junction.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The network of resistors for the above chip layout:</font></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0084.jpg" width="423" height="621"></p>

<p><font size="4">There are 12 R<sub>leads</sub> in parallel to represent the 12 
legs coming out of the chip.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">R<sub>plastic</sub> refers to the plastic case, which comes 
after the lead frame and before the leads.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For many of these resistances, use the resistance equation for 
heat flowing through a wall:</font></p>

<p><font size="4">L is the characteristic length. For the details on K and L, 
there's a table in the book:</font></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/table_15-01.jpg" width="830" height="1445"></p>

<p><font size="4">The above table assumes that the air pressure is 1 atm. If 
not, then we need to correct the &quot;h&quot; factor with the square root of the air 
pressure:</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier New" color="#ff8000" size="5">h<sub>conv, P atm</sub> = (h<sub>conv,

comparable to the magnitude of natural convection heat transfer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">If the hot body has just 1/3 of the

only 1/3 of the Q<sub>rad </sub>will actually happen. For example, in a chasis

<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0089.jpg" width="452" height="592"></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">only the PCBs on the two ends will see 
the cooler surrounding, and with 1/2 view at that. The PCBs not at the two ends 
will not have any heat lost due to radiation because they do not &quot;see&quot; a cooler 
surrounding around them. Mount any high power components on the ends because 
those places have the greatest heat transfer.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Placing PCBs too close to one another 
will &quot;choke&quot; the flow of heat. The distance between PCBs should be about 2 cm.</font></p>

<h2><font color="#008000">Fan Selection Issues</font></h2>

<p><font size="4">A fan at a fixed speed (or fixed rpm) will deliver a fixed 
volume of air regardless of the altitude and pressure. But the mass flow rate of 
air will be less at high altitude and low pressure due to the lower density of 
air.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Fan draw in not just cooler air but also all kinds of 
contaminants, so it's important to use a filter along with a fan. These 
contaminates can have poor heat conductivity factors, so if they get on top of 
components, they can cause the components to over heat.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It is usually best to place the fan at the inlet, rather than 
the exit of an electronic box. Placing the fan at the inlet makes it easier to 
filter the air going into the enclosure because if we placed the fan at the 
exit, then there could be multiple pathways for air to enter the enclosure. A 
fan at the inlet is more reliable because the fan itself is subjected to cool 
air.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The main problem with a fan at the inlet is that the heat 
generated by the fan and its motor is picked up by the air on its way into the 
box, which adds to the heat load of the system.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">One thing a fan does is to create a volume flow of air into 
the electronic box. Another thing that the fan does is to create a pressure drop 
from the inlet to the exit. From the view point of the fan, a fan has limited 
power and it can deliver greater volume flow of air with a smaller pressure 
drop. From the view point of the electronic box, there is a certain level of 
resistance to &quot;wind&quot; and a greater volume flow of air requires a greater 
pressure drop. These two different trends are satisfied at one particular
<font color="#008000">operating point</font>, a pressure and flow rate 
combination that is in both the behavior of the fan and the behavior of the 
system:</font></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0090.jpg" width="427" height="440"></p>

<p><font size="4">Place the most critical electronic components near the 
entrance, where the air is the coolest.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Arrange the circuit boards and electronic components in the 
box such that the resistance of the box to airflow is minimized. Make sure that 
no hot air pockets are formed during operation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Arrange the system such that natural convection helps forced 
convection rather than hurt it:</font></p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0091.jpg" width="455" height="608"></p>

<p><font size="4">If the system has a lot of resistance to &quot;wind&quot;, then have two 
fans in series. If the target is larger volume flow, use two fans in parallel.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><font color="#008000">Liquid Cooling</font></h2>

<p><font size="4">Circuit boards with up to about 5 W of power (or that have a 
power density of about 0.02 W/cm<sup>2</sup> can be cooled effectively by 
natural convection.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Liquids normally have much higher thermal conductivities than 
gases. A boiling liquid can also drain heat very quickly. Liquid can be used to 
directly on electronic components --- immersing the chip in a liquid, but in 
these cases the liquid needs to be a dielectric liquid, so no water. Liquid can 
be used to indirectly cool electronic components, and this approach can be done 
with cheap liquid like water.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In a car engine, water circulates through the passages around 
the cylinders of the engine block, absorbing heat generated in the cylinders by 
combustion. The heated water is then routed by the water pump to the radiator, 
where it is cooled by air blown through the radiator coils by the cooling fan.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In an <font color="#008000">open loop</font> system, the 
liquid is vaporized over time due to the heating from the electronic component. 
In a <font color="#008000">close loop</font> system, we collect the vapor and 
condense it back into the liquid.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Fluorocarbon fluids, such as FC78 and FC86 have boiling points 
ranging from 30 <sup>o</sup>C to 174 <sup>o</sup>C. They are nonflammable, 
chemically inert, and highly compatible with materials used in electric 
equipment. They can achieve very high heat transfer rates.</font></p>
