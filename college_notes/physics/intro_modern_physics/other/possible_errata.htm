<H3>Errata for Serway Physics for Scientists and Engineers (with Modern Physics) 
Fourth Edition</H3><PRE> 

 Note that some of the errors listed below have been corrected in the 
 Modern Physics edition.  

     Chapter Problem Page  Comments

     4       40       98   Assume that the ball is travelling counter-clockwise.
     5       17      132   Bad wording and incorrect answer.  The phrase 
                           "620-kg bucket of water" should be replaced 
                           by "620-kg bucket without water". Answer to 
                           part b) should be mass of water = 3620 kg.  
     5       47      136   Figure P5.47 incorrect and answer incorrect.
                           The figure has the mass values reversed from
                           the actual text of the question.  Answer in 
                           back should give tension of 42.2 N. 
     5       59      137   Diagram has reversed the values of the 1 and 2 kg 
                           blocks from the text description.  
     5       73      139   Bad wording.  Assume friction between top and 
                           bottom block.  
     7       90      201   The 'A' symbol in the diagram is the area of the 
                           circular end.  
     7       41      197   Answer to a) in back incorrect.  Should be
                           v = sqr[8mgh/(4m+M)].  
     8       27      227   Misprint.  The coefficient of kinetic 
                           friction between block and incline is uk, not 
                           mk.  
     8       29      227   Answer should be k = 914 N/m.
     10      21      299   The relation u=mM/(mM) at end of question 
                           should read u=mM/(m+M).  
     10      29      300   Answer in back correct if you remove the 
                           first two brackets to get 
                           m2sinO - u(m1 + m2cosO)/(m1 + m2 + M/2) 
                           all times g.  
     13       1    sg265*  The guide has written the equation 
                           x=(4.0)cos(3.0t+(pi)) instead of
                           x=(4.0)cos(3.0(pi)t+(pi)) and the subsequent
                           solutions in the guide are incorrect because
                           of this.  The answer given in the back of the
                           text however is correct.  
     13       7      382   "x=(2.00 cm)sin(3.00t)" should be 
                            x=(2.00 cm)sin(3(pi)t).
     13      23    sg269*  In  the solution 
                           "so (1/2)w(2)A(2) + w(2)x(2)=w(2)A(2)", the 
                           factor of (1/2) should be (1/4).  
     15      11      443   Solution assumes gauge pressure, ie
                           the final pressure does not include the  
                           atmospheric pressure.
     15      48      447   Hint: consider lowest pressure 
                           possible at the top of the tube.
     15      58      448   "by what distance h, does the water rise" should
                           read (delta) h as in the diagram.  
     16      17      475   Need the density of steel but assume density 
                           of iron close enough and found on page 422.  
     16      29      476   The phrase "travels to the left" should be either
                           travels down or in the negative direction.  
     18       4      521   Assume head of person is at the same height 
                           as the bottom speaker.
     23       1      674   Answer in back incorrect. Answer should be 
                           5.14 x 10(5)N.
     23      74      682   Length of dipole not strictly defined in
                           question.  Assume distance between charges
                           is 2a.
     24    Ex 24.7   692   Equation 24.7 has a misprint. E=2k(lambda)/l 
                           should read E=2k(lamda)/r.  
     24      60A     705   "where A and b are constants" should read 
                           "where A and B are constants".
     26      54      767   Assume the area of the plate connected to the spring is A.
     28      21    sg108*  Solution given in the Serway Study Guide
                           Vol. 2 has the bottom line I=Vab/Rab = .28 A.
                           This should be .23 A.  
     28      37    sg111*  Equation (3) has term +(2.0 ohms)(-I3) should
                           read +(2.0 ohms)(+I3).
     28      45      825   Answer on page A.58 has the term 
                           "e(-t/12.1)".  This should read "e(-t/12)", 
                           in other words, no ".1".  
     29       3      856   Answer on page A59 has "b2=0" which should 
                           read "bz=0." 
     29      21      857   Magnetic "force" should read magnetic 
                           "field".  
     30    Ex 30.7   874   Exercise refers to wire 3 which is not 
                           indicated on the diagram.  Wire 3 is at the 
                           bottom of the wire loop at the opposite end 
                           to wire 2.  
     31      25,25A  929   Answers to both questions on page A.60 are 
                           incorrect.  Answer to 25A should be 
                           I1=Bd(v2R3-v3R2)/(R1R2+R1R3+R2R3) where v2=4, 
                           v3=2, R1=5, R2=10, R3=15.  Using this 
                           equation the answer to 25 is 145 uA.  
     31      27      930   Diagram b) has the left-hand side winding 
                           direction not clearly matching the right-hand 
                           side winding direction.  Assume the left-hand 
                           side is the correct sense of direction of the 
                           windings.  
     36      37     1087   Bad wording. The nickel (not the image) is 
                           2.84 cm from the lens.  
     37      16     1111   There should be no L term in the equation.  
     37      19     1111   Answer = 641.     
     37      40     1112   Solution assumes that the index of refraction
                           of the substrate(the plane)is higher than the
                           index of refraction of the polymer.
     38      17     1141   Yes the answer is 20 cm.  An exceedingly
                           small car.
     38      71     1144   Numerical solution required.
     42       4     1282   Incorrect relation.  The phrase "momentum p
                           must be at least h(bar)r" should read 
                           h(bar)/2r.
