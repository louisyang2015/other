<p><b><font size="5" color="#008000">Linearity</font></b></p>
<p><font size="4">&quot;<b>Linear elements</b>&quot; include resistors, capacitors, 
linearly dependent sources. I am not sure what the criteria is --- but maybe 
when the Laplace transform is done on a function relating voltage and current, 
that function needs to be linear. Oh just accept it that resistors, capacitors, 
and linearly dependent sources are linear elements, and if a circuit is made of 
linear elements, then it's linear.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">If the circuit is linear, with a single source, and I am 
measuring the voltage across a particular resistor, then doubling that single 
source will also double the voltage across that resistor. The same idea applies 
to the current of the resistor --- double the source, get double current. This 
relationship is called &quot;<font color="#008000"><b>linearity</b></font>&quot; of the 
circuit.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">The linearity thing only works for voltages and currents --- 
maybe the criteria is that you do the Laplace transform on the equations 
involved, and the result is a linear transfer function.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Power is not a linear quantity --- so if you double the 
source, you won't get double the power. (twice current times twice voltage gives 
four times the power).</font></p>
<p><font size="4">A part of the book actually uses linearity to solve problems 
--- you basically assume the input voltage is ONE volt, and you solve the 
circuit say for the output voltage. Then the input voltage is really TWO volts, 
so you double the output voltage that you previously computed as use that as the 
answer. --- it's of course a rather silly way to solve problems --- the book 
just wants to show case the concept, that's all.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="5" color="#008000">Superposition</font></b></p>
<p><font size="4">If the circuit is linear, and you are computing a linear 
quantity, you can consider each source individually and add up their 
contributions. Say you want the voltage across a resistor and the circuit has 
two voltage sources: A and B.</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/pic0016.gif" width="632" height="244"></p>
<p><font size="4">You can set B to zero, and solve the circuit to see how much A 
contributes to the voltage across the resistor. Then you set A to zero, and 
solve the circuit to see how much B&nbsp; contributes to the voltage across the 
resistor. Finally you add the two contributions up to determine the final 
answer. It's like that linearity thing --- an important circuit concept, but 
much less important in terms of problem solving.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">To set a voltage source to zero is the same as replacing it 
with a short circuit. To set a current source to zero is the same as replacing 
it with an open circuit.</font></p>
