<h1 align="center"><font color="#008000">Scaling</font></h1>
<p><font size="4">If you have a known circuit and want to only modify a few 
things, then you might not have to redesign that whole circuit. Much of the 
following is common sense.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#008000">Magnitude Scaling:</font></p>
<p><font size="4">If you want the impedance over a resistor to be twice as big, 
use a resistor twice as big.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">If you want the impedance over an inductor to be twice as big, 
use an inductor twice as big.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">If you want the impedance over a capacitor to be twice as big, 
use an capacitor twice as small.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">For the series RLC and parallel RLC circuits, scaling all 
impedances by the same constant (K) does not change the circuit's resonance 
frequency, quality, and bandwidth.</font></p>
<p><font size="4" color="#008000">Frequency Scaling:</font></p>
<p><font size="4">Say you already have a circuit and its resonance frequency is 
known to be w<sub>0 </sub>. You would like to modify the circuit to produce 
resonance at a new frequency K*w<sub>0</sub> . What you need to do is to modify 
the components so that at the new frequency K*w<sub>0</sub> the components 
produce the same impedance as they use to produce at the old frequency w<sub>0</sub> 
.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A resistor produces the same impedance at all frequencies. No 
modification will be done to resistors.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The impedance of the old inductor L<sub>old</sub> at w<sub>0</sub> 
= the impedance of the new inductor ( L<sub>old </sub>/ K ) at the frequency ( K 
* w<sub>0 </sub>)</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The impedance of the old capacitor C<sub>old</sub> at w<sub>0</sub> 
= the impedance of the new capacitor ( C<sub>old </sub>/ K ) at the frequency ( 
K * w<sub>0 </sub>)</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Note: if you replace L<sub>old</sub> with L<sub>old</sub> / K, 
and replace C<sub>old</sub> with C<sub>old</sub> / K, then the resonance 
frequency will be moved from w<sub>0</sub> to K * w<sub>0</sub> . However, the 
quality factor is unchanged, so the bandwidth is enlarged: BW<sub>new</sub> = K 
* BW<sub>old</sub> .</font></p>
